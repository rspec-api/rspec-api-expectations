RSpec API Expectations
======================

RSpecApi::Expectations provides the `expect_resourceful` helper to any
RSpec example group tagged as `:rspec_api_resource`.

Basic example
-------------

    require 'faraday'
    response = Faraday.new('http://example.com/').get('/concerts')

    describe 'GET http://example.com/concerts', :rspec_api_resource do
      expect_resourceful response, status: :ok, type: :json, array: true
    end

The example above makes a `GET `'http://example.com/concerts'` request, then
check that the response:

* has a status code of 200 OK
* has the 'Content-Type' header set to 'application/json'
* has a JSON Array of Hashes (also called 'objects') in the body

Running the test above in RSpec produces the following output:

Available expectations
======================

The purpose of RSpecApi::Expectations is to give developers a tool to quickly
test that API endpoints respect some best practices that are common to
RESTful resourceful web APIs.

A list of best practices is available in [this great article by ...]; they
span from something as simple as "the status of a successful GET request should
be 200 OK" to something more complex as "the headers of a GET request for a
paginated list should include a link to the previous page".

RSpecApi::Expectations makes it easy to test whether any web API respects these
best practices by means of the `expect_resourceful` method. Here are all the
available expectations that can be tested with this method:

Status
------

    expect_resourceful response, status: :ok

Expects a specific HTTP status code in the response.
The status can be specified either as a number or as a [symbol](...)

Content Type
------------

    expect_resourceful response, type: :json

Expects a specific 'Content-Type' header in the response.
The status can be specified either as a string or as a [symbol](...).
By default, the expectation (best practice) is 'application/json'.
Note that this expectation always passes if the response status indicates
that there is no content at all (e.g. if the status is '204 No Content').

Collection
----------

    expect_resourceful response, collection: true

Expects the response body to either contain one or a collection of resources.
By default, the expectation is `collection: false`.

An example of a JSON response with one resource is:
`{"id": 1, "name": "foo"}`.
An example of a JSON response with a collection of resources is:
`[{"id": 1, "name": "foo"}, {"id": 2, "name": "bar"}]`.
